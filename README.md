# EvoLisaJS

A swing at creating EvoLisa using Javascript.

EvoLisa is a program by Roger Johansson that uses genertic algorithms to recreate a imagine of the Mona Lisa using just polygons.  The original .Net code can be found at https://rogerjohansson.blog/2008/12/07/genetic-programming-evolution-of-mona-lisa/

This version of it uses vanilla javascript, but does things in a way that may only be compatible with the latest browsers.  It was tested on the latest Chrome and worked just fine.  Your mileage may vary depending on what browser you use.

If you want to change the image, update the `data-img` attribute on the canvas in `index.js`.
